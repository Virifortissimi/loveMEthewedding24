              Hmmm Mercy, Mercy🥰🥰

              Mei as I fondly call her has been my best friend, gist mate and sister for more than 17 years now.

              Aside from being warm, gentle, kind and loving Mei loves Jehovah more than anything else. While  we  we’re still younger I lived with her family at kujore street in ojota and that was when I became an adopted sis to her. One thing you need to know is, there was never a dull moment with Mei and I can say when the Bible talks about a true friend at proverb to 17:17 that part of the Bible is talking about Mei because she will always stand by you🥺🤗🤗
            </p>
            
            <p class="py-3">
              One night we sneak out to buy suya, when grandma wanted to punish us she just said it’s not ify’s fault, I asked her to follow me🥺🥺I was surprised n move to tears that why is she taking all the blame when I was the one that brought up the idea😭😭😭 thank God grandma only dragged our ears never to leave the house late evening without informing anyone.
            </p>
            <p class="m-0">
              Mei has been a source of strong encouragement to me because she never stop telling me don’t worry God will make everything work out well 🥰🥰🥰 and this has kept me going till date. 

              Quick stride to the future. When she told me she me her bro Eghosa proposed I was super happy for her and am like waiting on Jehovah was the best choice ever and so far the wedding plans have been moving smoothly from the time of introduction till date Jehovah has been in full support. On the intro night when there was a little disagreement over the wedding date she was unhappy and she said I don’t want anything that would stress my mother in law and I am like don’t worry remember what you always tell me and we both chorused “God will make everything work out well”😂😂😂🤣🤣😂 and I pray and have confidence that he will supports this arrangement down to the very end🙏 

              Congratulations Mercy your home is blessed 🥰🥰😍😍🎈🎊🍾🎉

              Love and best wishes from Victoria

              Dearest Mercy,

              As your wedding day approaches, I wanted to take a moment to express my thoughts and feelings about your journey and the significance of this beautiful occasion.
              Over the years, I've had the privilege of witnessing your incredible growth and transformation. From the moment I met you, I knew there was something special about you. And since that moment I appreciated being your friend. Seeing you evolve into the remarkable person you are today has been truly inspiring. You have faced your challenges and shortcomings with grace, embraced your strengths, and continually strived to become the best version of yourself.

            </p>
            
            <p class="py-3">
              Now, as you stand on the brink of a new chapter in your life with Eghosa, I am filled with joy and gratitude. The love that you both share is evident in every glance, every touch, and every smile you exchange. It's a love built on trust, respect, and unwavering support, and it's a love that will undoubtedly continue to grow stronger with each passing day.
            </p>
            <p class="m-0">
              As you prepare to exchange vows and embark on this lifelong journey together, know that your wedding is not just a celebration of love, but a reflection of the beautiful bond you share and the countless memories you've already created. It's a testament to the love, commitment, and dedication you have for each other, and it's a symbol of the bright future that awaits you both.

              May your wedding day be filled with laughter, joy, and endless love, and may your marriage be blessed with happiness, prosperity, and a lifetime of cherished memories.

              I love you baby girl❤️

              

              With love and best wishes,

              I met Mercy about a year ago and all I can say is that she's amazing. 
              Although she has been a friend of my husband since 2017 
              we know next to nothing about her coz she is very reserved and 
              an introvert. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="py-3">
              I made it a goal to know this fine tall glass of wine and 
              trust me it was worth it. She has a calm demeanor, 
              she's soft, sweet and beautiful inside out. 
              Mercy is going to make a good wife, companion and mother. 
              She's respectful, selfless even when under pressure and all 
              smiles😁 and above all, a lover. She can't wait to start her 
              new journey with her Man and I pray Jehovah grants her a 
              great marriage.
            </p>
            <p class="m-0">
              I love her to the moon and will miss her alot.🩷

            <p class="fst-italic py-3">
              I’ve known Eghosa for over a decade, and over that time, I’ve had the pleasure of witnessing the incredible person he is. We’ve had lots of memories together, from the days of university until now. Like myself, Eghosa enjoys adventure and we’ve been to many places together.
            </p>
            
            <p class="py-3">
              I’m jealous that Mercy will now enjoy the longer and best part of his adventurous lifestyle. One memory that stands out is how he came to my help when I desperately needed a place to stay.
            </p>
            <p class="m-0">
              Amongst other things, this reflects his positive qualities such as kindness and generosity. Eghosa has a great sense of humour, he is a loyal friend, a hardworking fellow and a friend with a large heart. Mercy probably has a little idea of the amazing, loving, generous and adventurous man she’s about to spend the rest of her life with.
